# KiCad-Libraries
To add the footprint library, go to Assign footprints ->  Manage footprint libraries -> Add existing library and select the MREx.pretty folder. Alternatively, from the main KiCad project go to Preferences ->  Manage footprint libraries -> Add existing library and select the MREx.pretty folder. The library “MREx” will then appear in the footprint library list and you will be able to access its footprints in Assign footprints. When updates are made to the library, pull origin in the cloned repo (clone this repo) and KiCad will use the updated library automatically.
